# Android-Bluetooth-Student
This app works with the other repo "Android Bluetooth Teacher". The teacher is able to send customizable questions to student(s).
The questions pop up on the student app, answers can be selected, and sent back. Data is received back to the teacher as a plain text 
file; nothing is done with it.
